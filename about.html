    <!--<h2 id="personal-life">Welcome to my Personal Life!</h2>
    <p class="personal-life">Just like my professional life I never settle for less in anything either it's fun, friends and family. I like to travel and eat alot and with that I also love to spend sometime at the gym to keep myself fit which is really important in our generation these days! My life is inspired by "Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani" which teaches us to live our day at the best with some planning for the future. In sports I love to skate and also I am always attracted to play Cricket and Badminton at anytime of the clock. With that swimming has always played an important role in my life since it was the very first event I took part in. With this I am a little active on social media as well. I would be so glad if you could have a look below on those!</p>
